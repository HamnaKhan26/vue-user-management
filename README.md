# Vue-powered View

## Intro

Thank you for taking the time to come in to meet with the Closinglock engineering team! Here's an exercise to work through. As important as getting to a working example today might feel, we are really interested to see how you work and approach problems. Please feel free to think out loud or ask us questions.

## Assignment

We have a legacy UI that we would like to migrate to Vue.

Create a Vue app that uses this [dummy API](https://dummyjson.com/users) to retrieve a list of users. Your app can look similar to what exists currently, and we're open to any improvements you can bring.

This isn't a gotcha exercise, it's as straightforward as it sounds. The goal to generate some talking points about how you approach fundamentals.

Let's aim to talk through where things are in thirty minutes.

Good luck!
